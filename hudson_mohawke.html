		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hudson Mohawke (Ross Birchard) has been on a meteoric rise the last few years, working with some of the biggest names in hip hop, pop and dance music but everything started in a bedroom in Glasgow when he was barely a teenager. From age 15 he was an award winning scratch DJ producing happy hardcore on cracked software - he came to define a generation of electronic fusion producers but unlike many of his peers, Hudson has matured into a fully fledged contemporary hitmaker continually working to break the mold.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born of the underground club scene in the UK, ‘Hud Mo’ has been releasing music for the last 10 years, cultivating a formidable presence in the community. His US break-out came in 2012 with TNGHT, the collaborative project with fellow producer Lunice, which saw their production influence the A-list in rap and help reintroduce the US dance / EDM scene to Hip Hop as club music. In the two years following, Hudson has worked on releases from Drake, Kanye West, John Legend, Young Thug, Pusha-T, and Antony Hegarty.</p><br>
